# Living-receiver
A Homebrew Sorcerer Sub-Class for Aurora Character Builder




When events are set in motion that can disrupt the Multiverse, a Diety of Fate or Time, can create a champion to prevent such calamity. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen, but the Receiver must be a mortal creature. The Living Receiver is blessed with Tangential Powers. These include increased strength and martial knowledge, telekinesis, mind control, and the ability to conjure fire and water. The wellspring of Tangential Powers, granted by a Diety of Fate or Time, lie adjacent to the Entropic Energy that seeks to ensure the calamity event. The Living Receiver can access this Entropic Energy to bolster their abilities, but are often tormented by terrifying dreams, visions, and auditory hallucinations, when they do. As the Living Receiver grows more powerful, they can begin to weave the Entropic Energy with their Tangential Powers to manipulate those around them. Those affected are known as the Manipulated and will fear and try to destroy them.

TANGENTIAL MAGIC
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Receiver Magic table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.


CHAMPION RESILIENCE
Your body is infused with divine resilience. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.


MARTIAL KNOWLEDGE
you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, and simple weapons.

EXTRA ATTACK
. Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of you cantrips in place of one of those attacks.


ENTROPIC RESTORATION
Once per long rest, as an action, you can open yourself to the well of Entropic power to replenish exhausted Sorcerer Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus. Immediately after using this feature, roll on the Tangential Madness table.


IMPROVED MARTIAL KNOWLEDGE
At 14th level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.


MANIPULATED VIOLENCE
. At 14th level, once per long rest, as a bonus action, you awaken a sense of fear and rage within the creatures around you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened of you and drawn to you for 1 minute. This effect is as if you were concentrating on a spell. For the duration, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while you are within line of sight. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you. If it succeeds on this saving throw, the target's movement isn't restricted for that turn. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turn to end the effect. Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you can spend 5 sorcery points to use this feature again.


RECEIVERS ASCENSION
. At 18th level, your Tangential Powers reach their zenith. Your Strength and Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22.
